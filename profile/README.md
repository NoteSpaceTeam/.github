**NoteSpace** is a collaborative web platform that combines real-time collaboration with version control systems. It combines Google Docs' synchronous editing with GitHub's workspace organization, sharing, and version control. Users can collaborate on markdown-based documents in real time, organize them into workspaces and folders, track changes through commits, and share or clone public workspaces.

---

## Real-Time Collaboration
Edit the same document with multiple people at once. Changes sync instantly, even with concurrent edits, while keeping everyone in a consistent state, using the Fugue CRDT algorithm.

## Workspace Management
Organize notes and documents into workspaces and folders, with workspace-based access control for shared collaboration.

## Markdown Support
Write using markdown with live rendering. Supports standard formatting for fast, clean note-taking and technical documentation, such as headers, list items, and more.

## Version Control
Track changes, view past versions, and revert when needed using the built-in version control system.
